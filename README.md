# School python calculator thingy
This repo has a few random python demonstrations I needed to perform for School.
PyCalc is an obnoxiously flamboyant calculator that works by importing functions from calcfunctions. Neither have any real practical use, but whatever.
EvgenyAddition was a file created by a mentor to give me a bit of an insight into the weirder bits of python, such as lamda functions.
